React Part Explanation:
Hash Generation:

We use crypto.subtle.digest() to create the SHA-256 hash in JavaScript. This method returns a Promise, so we need to await the hash generation.
The TextEncoder().encode() encodes the string to a Uint8Array before hashing.
The hash is then converted into a hexadecimal string to match the PHP hash('sha256', $string) output.
fetch() API:

We use the fetch() API to send a POST request to http://www.myproject.com/checkRequest.
The request's body is converted to JSON using JSON.stringify(), and the appropriate headers (Content-Type: 'application/json') are set.
Handling Response:

After sending the request, the response is awaited and then displayed on the page.
We update the state using setResponse() to show the server response.
Error Handling:

Any errors in the fetch request are caught and logged, and the error message is displayed.
Additional Notes:
CORS: Ensure that http://www.myproject.com/checkRequest allows cross-origin requests (CORS) from your React application. If not, you may encounter CORS errors.
Backend: The backend should handle the POST request and check the hash, similar to what you have in your PHP code.



PHP Server Recieve Part Explanation
Explanation:
Secret Key:
The $secret_key is the same shared secret used when generating the hash in React (or any client-side application).

Retrieve POST Data:
The $_POST array is used to access the incoming user_id, amount, TRX, and hash values. These values are fetched with null checks (?? '') to ensure that the script doesn't crash if any value is missing.

Hash Recalculation:
The server recalculates the hash using the received user_id, amount, TRX, and the shared $secret_key.

Hash Verification:
The newly generated hash ($expected_hash) is compared with the received hash ($received_hash). If they match, it means the request is valid.

Response:

If the hash is valid, a JSON response with { "status": "success", "message": "Request is valid" } is returned.
If the hash doesn't match, the response will be { "status": "error", "message": "Invalid hash" }.
If required fields are missing, an appropriate error message is returned.
